DEBUGGING:
    - Fix stack guard page
    - Add stub exception handlers in the IDT as early as possible to catch DIV0 etc
    - Fix makefile to build debug
    - Compress kernel to allow bigger kernel in ISO
    - Fix call to swift::fatalError() to work correctly

Fix vasprintf() as used by assert()
Improve backtrack/stacktrace
ACPI: Setup acpi as a device
Fix string sorting for ASCII / Decide on libicu stub
Add MemoryManager and TaskManager classes.
Add Resource manager for i/o ports and mmio
IOAPIC: PCI interrupt routing
Reduce the number of global values and functions
Better setup of initial mapping to not waste physical page for guardpage
Locks for hardware access eg PIC
Enable multicore
MOSTLY DONE fix keyboard scan codes and full scan code
Shrink down boot16to64.bin
use struct/class more consistenly and fixup what should be singletons etc
    DONE - convert device drivers to all be classes
    CPU &
    DONE Bootparams still needs fixing

MAYBE Implement malloc() in swift

DONE Load kernel as ELF and implement dladdr()/backtrace() (-z max-page-size=0x1000)
