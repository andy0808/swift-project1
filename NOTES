Debugging:

readelf --debug-dump=line <elf file>

use -ggdb for C/C++ sources
dont not use and -g options for swift sources as

1. GDB doesnt understand swift anyway
2. Linking swift debug and c debug, even if both are the same DWARF type means that only the swift files
   show up in `info sources`. Even though an ELF file which is mixed will show both with the above readelf
   command

3. Currently build with --debug-swift-stdlib to get the debug (none optimized) runtime to link with all of the
   extra c++ string functions.
should show what source files are known about.


qemu can only be used with GDB
vmware can be used with both GDB and LLDB - LLDB better as it understands Swift source code

Wehn using with GDB, dont compile with -g on Swift soruces as GDB gets confused by the DWARF info.

VMWare better emulator but the remote debugging can sometime cause it to hang on exit.
